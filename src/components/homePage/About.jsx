Every time you load a new text is automatically stored, so while you keep the tab open if you go offline or want to practice again with texts that you already used, the text will be take it from the "Store" and not from the Web (Basically it won't use your Internet again and again). When you are done and close the tab, all stored texts will be deleted</p>
